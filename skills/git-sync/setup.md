# Setup: Git Sync for Your Claude Code Environment

This recipe turns `~/.claude` into a Git repository and connects it to a private GitHub repository, so you have version history and can keep two machines in sync. Read `README.md` first if you want the why; this file is the how.

You can run every step yourself, or you can let Claude Code run them for you.

## Let Claude Code do it

Open Claude Code in any project and say:

> Read `git-sync/setup.md` and set up Git sync for my `~/.claude` environment, then tell me how to use it.

Claude Code will create the private repository (or get you through `gh auth login` first), write the `.gitignore`, scan for secrets, make the first commit and push, install the `claude-push` and `claude-pull` commands, and explain the daily routine. The rest of this file is the same recipe written out, for doing it by hand or for following along while Claude Code works.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed (`git --version`).
- A GitHub account.
- One of: the GitHub CLI (`gh`), or an SSH key added to your GitHub account. The steps below use `gh` as the primary path and note the SSH alternative where it differs.

Throughout, replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `claude-env` with whatever you want to name the repository.

## Step 1: Create a private GitHub repository

**With the GitHub CLI (recommended).**

```
gh auth login            # once per machine, if you have not already
gh repo create claude-env --private --description "My Claude Code environment"
```

Do not initialize it with a README. You want it empty, so your first push defines the history.

**With SSH instead of the CLI.** Create an empty private repository in the GitHub web UI (no README, no `.gitignore`, no license). Make sure you have an SSH key on this machine that is added to your GitHub account; `ssh -T git@github.com` should greet you by username. You will use the `git@github.com:USERNAME/claude-env.git` remote URL in Step 4.

## Step 2: Initialize Git in ~/.claude and add the .gitignore

```
cd ~/.claude
git init -b main
```

Copy `gitignore.sample` from this directory to `~/.claude/.gitignore`. It is shipped under that name so it does not take effect inside the recipe's own folder; once copied to `~/.claude/.gitignore` it becomes active for your environment. It uses an allowlist: it ignores everything, then re-includes only the authored paths (`CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `settings.json`, `settings.local.json`, `keybindings.json`, `skills/`, `scripts/`, `protocols/`, `changelog/`, `hooks/`, the two sync scripts, and `projects/*/memory/`). Open it and add a line for any other root-level file you author and want tracked.

## Step 3: Scan for secrets before the first commit

Even though the repository is private, do not commit keys or tokens. Check what is about to be tracked:

```
cd ~/.claude
git add -A
git status                          # review the file list
git diff --cached | grep -nEi 'api[_-]?key|secret|token|password|bearer|-----BEGIN' || echo "No obvious secrets found."
```

The scan flags candidates to review, not certain secrets. It will also match documentation that merely mentions a word like "token" or "key," which is fine; look at each hit and decide. If anything sensitive shows up, add its path or pattern to `.gitignore`, then run `git rm --cached <path>` and re-check. The sample already excludes `.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, and `.credentials.json` everywhere.

## Step 4: First commit and push

```
cd ~/.claude
git commit -m "Baseline: authored Claude Code environment"
```

Add the remote and push. The CLI may have set the remote when you created the repo; if `git remote -v` shows nothing, add it:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/claude-env.git    # or git@github.com:USERNAME/claude-env.git for SSH
git push -u origin main
```

Your environment now has a history and a private copy on GitHub.

## Step 5: Install the two commands

Copy `claude-push.sh` and `claude-pull.sh` from this directory into `~/.claude`, make them executable, and put them on your PATH:

```
cp claude-push.sh claude-pull.sh ~/.claude/
chmod +x ~/.claude/claude-push.sh ~/.claude/claude-pull.sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -sf ~/.claude/claude-push.sh ~/.local/bin/claude-push
ln -sf ~/.claude/claude-pull.sh ~/.local/bin/claude-pull
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your PATH. If it is not, add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`). Open a new terminal and confirm:

```
command -v claude-push && command -v claude-pull
```

## Step 6: Add a second machine (optional)

You have two clean options on the second machine.

**Fresh start (simplest).** If the second machine has nothing in `~/.claude` you need to keep, back up whatever is there, then clone:

```
mv ~/.claude ~/.claude.bak-$(date +%Y%m%d)            # only if ~/.claude already exists
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/claude-env.git ~/.claude
```

Then repeat Step 5 on this machine to install the commands.

**Keep this machine's existing edits.** If the second machine already has a `~/.claude` you want to preserve, adopt the shared history in place:

```
cd ~/.claude
git init -b main
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/claude-env.git
git fetch origin
git reset --mixed origin/main          # adopt the remote history, keep your files on disk
git add -A
git commit -m "Local state on second machine"
git pull --no-rebase --no-edit origin main    # merge the two histories
git push origin main
```

Where the same file exists on both machines with different contents, this machine's copy becomes the new shared version on the push. If you want the first machine's version of a particular file instead, restore it with `git checkout origin/main -- path/to/file` before you commit.

This is exactly the kind of step Claude Code can run for you: point it at this file on the second machine and ask it to connect the machine to your existing repository.

## Day-to-day use

- Sitting down at a machine: `claude-pull` to get the other machine's latest edits.
- Finishing up: `claude-push "short note about what changed"` to commit and send them. The message is optional; the script supplies a default if you omit it.

`claude-push` pulls before it pushes, so if you forgot to pull at the start, or pushed out of order from the other machine, non-conflicting edits merge automatically. If the same lines were changed on both machines, the sync stops and asks you to resolve the conflict (see the next section). On a single machine, `claude-push` alone is a fine commit-and-back-up habit.

## If a sync stops on a conflict

A conflict happens only when the same lines of the same file were changed on both machines before they synced. Git cannot guess which version you want, so the sync stops and leaves both versions in the file, marked like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
your version on this machine
=======
the version from the other machine
>>>>>>> origin/main
```

To resolve it, open the file, delete the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` marker lines, keep the text you want (it can be a blend of both), then run:

```
git -C ~/.claude add -A
git -C ~/.claude commit --no-edit
```

Run `claude-push` again to send the resolved version. Your committed work is never lost in a conflict: the scripts commit local edits before they pull, so resolving is always just an edit and a commit, never a recovery. Claude Code can do this for you if you ask it to open the file and remove the markers.

## Running it from inside Claude Code

You do not need a separate terminal for the routine sync. `claude-push` and `claude-pull` are ordinary commands on your PATH, so Claude Code can run them through its Bash tool in the same session it does other work. Point Claude Code at this directory, let it install the commands, and it can run the pull and push for you from then on.

One thing does need a terminal, just once: interactive authentication. Claude Code's Bash tool runs a non-interactive shell, so it cannot answer a login or passphrase prompt. Do the one-time auth in a terminal yourself:

- `gh auth login` (browser or device-code flow), or
- add an SSH key to your agent and to GitHub, or
- enter the first HTTPS credential so your credential helper caches it.

After that, the credential is stored (keychain, SSH agent, or `gh`), the push becomes non-interactive, and Claude Code can run `claude-push` and `claude-pull` end to end. The case to avoid is a passphrase-protected SSH key with no agent loaded, or an uncached HTTPS login: either would stall a non-interactive run waiting for input. Get auth into a non-prompting state once, and the day-to-day stays inside Claude Code.

If Claude Code installs the commands and then cannot find `claude-push` in the same session, that is the shell-snapshot quirk described in the Appendix: the bare command has not been picked up yet. The scripts self-heal on the next run, or you can call the script by its full path, `~/.claude/claude-push.sh`, which always resolves.

## Rollback and revert

Because every machine holds the full shared history after a pull, you can undo a committed change from either machine:

- See history: `git -C ~/.claude log --oneline`
- Inspect a change: `git -C ~/.claude show <commit>`
- Undo one commit, keeping later work: `git -C ~/.claude revert <commit>`
- Restore one file to an earlier version: `git -C ~/.claude checkout <commit> -- path/to/file`

Then `claude-push` to send the revert to the other machine, which picks it up on its next `claude-pull`. The only change you cannot reach from the other machine is one you never committed or never pushed, so push when you finish.

## Appendix: Claude Code shell-snapshot hygiene (optional)

The bottom of each script has a short, clearly marked block you can delete if you do not want it. It exists because of one Claude Code quirk: Claude Code captures a snapshot of your shell once and replays it on every command it runs, instead of re-reading your shell profile each time. If you add a new command (like `claude-push`) and then ask Claude Code to run it in the same setup session, the cached snapshot may not know about it yet, and the command appears "not found."

The block fixes this in two idempotent steps every time you push or pull: it re-creates the PATH symlinks for `claude-push` and `claude-pull` so they resolve as real files regardless of the snapshot, and it clears the stale snapshot so the next Claude Code session rebuilds it from your current profile. None of this affects your interactive terminal; it only keeps Claude Code's own shell current. If you never run these commands through Claude Code, the block is harmless, and you can remove it.

## What is tracked, and what is not

Tracked: your authored text. `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, settings, keybindings, `skills/`, `scripts/`, `protocols/`, `changelog/`, `hooks/`, the two sync scripts, and per-project memory under `projects/*/memory/`.

Not tracked: everything else, by default. Session transcripts, caches, runtime state, downloaded plugins, and large binaries stay out. That keeps the repository small and free of noise, and it is why this is version control for your configuration, not a backup of your whole environment. Keep a separate full backup for recovery.
