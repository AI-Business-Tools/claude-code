# Skills Catalog

Each skill is a self-contained workflow that Claude Code loads on demand when your request matches its triggers. Most install by copying `SKILL.md` to `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`; the two flagged exceptions install differently per their READMEs.

## Dependencies

Some skills reference [style guides](../style-guides/) for formatting rules. If you install a skill that references a style guide, install the style guide too, or replace the reference with your own formatting standards.

## Customization

These skills are starting points. Adapt them to your own workflows:

- Change trigger phrases to match how you naturally ask for things
- Adjust quality gate criteria to match your standards
- Replace style guide references with your own formatting rules
- Add or remove pipeline steps as needed
